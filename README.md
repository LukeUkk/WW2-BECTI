# WW2-BECTI
Lukes and Cross version of Bennys BECTI converted to WW2 mods

Road map

Decide if we are gonna make an independent team for the USA ww2 units as they are indpendent or we can just replace the gear like we do.

* Add custom WW2 Units and vehs to the factories  \\\\ Common\Config\Factories "All files"

* Add custom WW2 Defenses blufor & opfor & Indp   \\\\ Common\Config\Defenses "All Files"

* Add custom WW2 bases for blufor & opfor in      \\\\ Common\Config\Base "Base_West/East.sqf"

* Change all Gear for blufor & opfor and replce with ww2 \\\\ Common\Config\Gear "Gear_East/west"

* Change all squads to ww2 \\\\ Common\Config\Squads "Squads_E/W"

* Add units created in factory_E/W.sqf in to the correct places in \\\\ Common\Config\Towns "All files"

* Again set units used from another file done and replce the units in \\\\ Common\Config\Units "West/East/Idpn"

[B PLAN ]
* Luke Focus on USA gear units ect 
* Cross Focus on Russian gear \\\\ Link to help https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/127617-classnames/
